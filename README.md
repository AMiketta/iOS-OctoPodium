Github Awards

Check how you rank on your location based on your number of stars of your repositories on github. You can compare yourself with other devs from your city, country or worldwide.

This app uses the API provided by the GithubAwads web app made by Vincent Daubry (Github: https://github.com/vdaubry, Twitter: https://twitter.com/vdaubry).

As the web version, this is not affiliated with the GitHub company in any way.
